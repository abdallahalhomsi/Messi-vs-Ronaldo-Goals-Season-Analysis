# Messi-vs-Ronaldo-Goals-Season-Analysis

**Project Description:**

Comparative analysis of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo's season-by-season goal-scoring trends. This DSA210 Spring 2024-2025 project at Sabanci University utilizes publicly available datasets from Kaggle and employ data analysis techniques in Python (Pandas and Matplotlib) to calculate key metrics, such as (e.g., total goals per season, average goals per season). These metrics will be compared using appropriate statistical methods like tests to assess the statistical significance of any observed differences. Graphs will be used to visualize the yearly goal-scoring trajectories, providing a clear and concise comparison of these two football legends' goal-scoring performance.

**Motivation:**

My journey as a professional footballer in Jordan's national team, with several appearances in the first team, instilled in me a deep appreciation for the dedication and precision required for peak performance. This project serves as a unique opportunity to combine my passion for football with my growing enthusiasm for coding and data science. I aim to use my analytical skills and knowledge of the game to uncover meaningful insights, enhancing both my understanding of football and my data analysis abilities.

**Datasets:**

* **Lionel Messi Dataset:**
    * **Name:** Lionel Messi | All Club Goals
    * **Source:** kaggle.com 
    * **Source Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/azminetoushikwasi/-lionel-messi-all-club-goals/data
    * **Download Command:** !kaggle datasets download -d azminetoushikwasi/-lionel-messi-all-club-goals

* **Cristiano Ronaldo Dataset:**
    * **Name:** Cristiano Ronaldo | All Club Goals
    * **Source:** kaggle.com
    * **Source Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/azminetoushikwasi/cr7-cristiano-ronaldo-all-club-goals-stats
    * **Download Command:** !kaggle datasets download -d azminetoushikwasi/cr7-cristiano-ronaldo-all-club-goals-stats

**Data Collection and Preparation:**

The datasets were obtained from Kaggle using the commands shown above. Python Libraries will be used on these data like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn. The data will undergo the following preparation steps:

* **Data Cleaning:** Missing values in any column will be handled by removing rows with missing data, as it is crucial for data analysis and any inconsistent formatting will be addressed by standardization
* **Data Transformation:** A new column, 'Total Goals', will be created for both datasets which will contain the sum of all goals scored in each season (e.g., UCL, Laliga, World Cup)
* **Data Validation:** Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, min, max) will be calculated for the 'Total Goals' column for each player to assess the data's distribution and identify potential outliers

**Technology Stack:**

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn (Optional)
* Kaggle API

**Timeline:**

* **March 10, 2025:** Project Proposal Submission (This README file)
* **April 18, 2025:** Exploratory Data Analysis and hypothesis tests on the data
* **May 23, 2025:** Apply ML methods on the dataset
* **May 30, 2025:** Final Report Submission
